## Abstract

Containerized environments rely on optimized storage backends to achieve the best I/O performance, handling snapshots, and system reliability. This research implements LucidBench, a Docker-based filesystem benchmarking tool that automates the testing of different filesystems across various storage devices. The tool provides comprehensive performance analysis of storage backends in containerized environments, with a focus on real-world workload patterns and system resource utilization. Our experimental results demonstrate significant performance variations across different storage types and filesystems, with NVMe SSDs showing up to 5x better IOPS performance compared to traditional HDDs. The analysis reveals critical insights into resource utilization patterns and container overhead, providing valuable guidance for storage backend selection in containerized environments.

## Introduction

The rapid adoption of containerized applications in enterprise computing, artificial intelligence, and cloud-native workloads necessitates a deep understanding of storage performance trade-offs. Docker provides several storage drivers whose performance is greatly influenced by workload type and underlying storage devices. This complexity is further compounded by the diverse range of storage technologies available, from traditional hard disk drives (HDDs) to high-performance NVMe solid-state drives (SSDs).

The proliferation of container technology, notably Docker, across diverse enterprise and cloud-native infrastructures emphasizes the necessity for efficient, reliable, and scalable storage solutions. This research implements LucidBench, an automated benchmarking tool that provides insights into storage performance characteristics across different device types and filesystems. The tool addresses the critical need for standardized performance evaluation in containerized environments, where storage performance can significantly impact application behavior and resource utilization.
## Research Questions

This study aims to address the following key research questions:

1. **Performance Characteristics:** How do different Docker storage backends perform across various storage devices (HDD, SATA SSD, NVMe SSD) in terms of:
   - IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)
   - Throughput
   - Latency
   - CPU and RAM utilization

2. **Workload Impact:** How do different I/O patterns affect storage performance in containerized environments?
   - Random vs. sequential access patterns
   - Read vs. write operations
   - Mixed workload scenarios
   - Block size variations

3. **Resource Utilization:** What is the relationship between storage performance and system resource utilization?
   - CPU overhead of different storage drivers
   - Memory consumption patterns
   - I/O wait times and system load
